title = "Robbery at the Market"
description = "John Doe, a 22-year-old male, is facing charges related to a theft incident that occurred at a local convenience store on the evening of April 14th. According to witness statements and surveillance footage, Mr. Doe entered the store alone at approximately 9:45 PM and proceeded directly to the front counter after briefly pacing around the aisles. While he did not display any weapon, he reportedly made a verbal threat to the cashier, demanding money from the register and implying harm if the cashier did not comply. |Fearing for their safety, the cashier handed over approximately $500 in cash, after which Mr. Doe quickly exited the store on foot.

Notably, the incident involved no physical violence or property damage. The verbal threat, however, was taken seriously by both the victim and responding law enforcement officers, who apprehended Mr. Doe later that evening based on a description provided by the cashier and store surveillance recordings. He was cooperative at the time of arrest and did not resist officers.

|Mr. Doe has no previous criminal record and has never been involved in any known criminal investigations or legal infractions. He is currently employed part-time at a local warehouse, working roughly 20 hours per week. In addition, he is enrolled at the local community college, where he is pursuing an associate degree in business administration. His academic record indicates consistent, if not exceptional, performance, and he has no known behavioral issues on campus.

Family members and acquaintances describe Mr. Doe as quiet and generally responsible, although recently he has been under financial stress due to rising tuition costs and a reduction in work hours. During initial interviews with authorities, he expressed remorse for his actions, |citing desperation and a lapse in judgment rather than any intention to cause real harm.

The court will need to weigh several factors in considering sentencing or diversion options, including the non-violent nature of the crime, Mr. Doeâ€™s lack of prior offenses, his educational and employment commitments, and his expressed willingness to make restitution."
correct_verdict = "2 years probation and 200 hours community service"
lenient_verdict = "6 months probation with no community service"
harsh_verdict = "5 years imprisonment"
explanation = "First-time offenders who commit non-violent theft without weapons typically receive probation with community service. The amount stolen ($500) is significant but not extreme, and rehabilitation is prioritized over incarceration for first offenses."
